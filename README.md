# Dialogue_Exchange
A program that simulates talking to an NPC with limited options.
I wanted to figure out a process where the user is given a choice and the program will give a response based on that choice.
the inspiration comes from playing various games that are text heavy, but commonly lack a way to engage the conversation.
I found this to be very enjoyable to code out in C++ hopefully I can find a better way to code this with more text and options.
